# EP Rec'ing crew website

This was a website I designed and created in adobe Muse for a local soccer club, [EP Rec'ing Crew](eprecingcrew.com).

## Home Page

The home page was a simple static informational page with no dynamic components

## Team Page

The site had to support Multiple teams posting individual schedules to their own pages. I decided to go with a service called UpTo for this. I implemented the calendar from the service into the layout of the individual team page.

## Gallery

The site also needed to have an overall gallery for the club. Instead of having them post images to their site through some custom CMS I decided to just pull the images straight from their facebook page. This allowed me to bring in facebook's comments and likes along with simplifying the image upload process for my client.

## Sponsors page

The club wanted to give their sponsors a reason to want to donate along with a new way to generate some income for their club. I suggested a Sponsors page that would showcase sponsors and link to their sites.

## Contact page

Their contact page needed more than just one contact form because they wanted to make their diverse group of clients feel at home and comfortable speaking in their native tongue.
